    overview:
      'Solo Leveling Journal is a self-designed productivity platform that applies game design principles and behavioral psychology to habit formation. Instead of relying on reminders or streak pressure, the system transforms daily routines into measurable progress through XP, levels, and achievement-based feedback loops. The product was engineered to maximize long-term engagement while maintaining cognitive simplicity.',

    scope:
      'The project involved end-to-end product development, including system architecture, UX research, interface design, and frontend engineering. I designed the progression logic, data persistence model, and interaction framework, ensuring high performance, offline reliability, and extensibility for future analytics and cloud synchronization features.',

    goals:
      'The primary objective was to build a sustainable habit-building system that encourages intrinsic motivation rather than dependency on external rewards. Additional goals included scalability, modular architecture, and long-term maintainability, enabling future integration of adaptive difficulty, behavioral insights, and cross-device synchronization.',
