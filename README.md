# WorkPortfolio — Frontend & UI Systems

A production-grade frontend portfolio showcasing scalable UI systems, interaction design, and real-world application architecture.

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio — designed to reflect how I think, design, and build frontend systems in professional environments.

## Why This Portfolio Exists

This is not a visual gallery.

It is a **systems-first frontend portfolio** built to demonstrate:

- How I structure UI at scale
- How I think about interaction, state, and performance
- How design and engineering decisions translate into real products
- How I communicate intent through code, motion, and hierarchy
